# Roadmap

The roadmap is likely that priorities will change, but the list below gives an idea about next planned features.

## Planned Features

- Adding extension framework to make implementing new features easier to mongoclient for newbies. That means there'll be an addon section on mongoclient. 
- Change blaze template to REACT.
- Move to ES6
- SQL Queries
- Improving dump/restore section to make it more usable. Currently it's experimental.
- [x] A fully covered migration tool for version transitions of mongoclient. (Import connections, dumps, settings from an older version) 
- Writing a brief documentation about contributing and using mongoclient and more. 

Apart from these, all open issues, include upcoming enhancements or bug-fixes to be implemented
